# lecture_R

This is an introduction (really short, 4 hours lecture) for psychology doctoral students at Aix Marseille University. It aims at giving a first contact with the R language to students and is a pre-requisite to another course.


# Instructions on the installation
To create the lectures and material I use a conda environment on a linux machine (x64 - ubuntu 16.04).

You can directly recreate the conda environment with the "environment.yml" file (see https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file ) 

Then launch jupyter notebook and proceed with the .ipynb
